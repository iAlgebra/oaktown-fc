			<h1>Welcome to Oaktown Football Club</h1>
			<p>Oaktown’s local football club plays every weekend during the football season.<br/>We are very much a family orientated club with a strong focus on friendly competition and strong sporting ethics.<br/>We strive to provide opportunities for all members to develop their soccer skills in a supportive yet friendly<br/>team environment.</p>
			<p>The club was founded in 1978 and has had a strong membership ever since.<br/>We welcome new members and are always looking for volunteers to coach, help run the canteen and generally<br/>help out during the season.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions, come along during a training session or after a game and introduce yourself.<br/>Alternately you can find the Club Secretary’s contact details on our <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>
